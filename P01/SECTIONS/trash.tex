    \caption{Estimation of statistical and systematic uncertainties for three scenarios: a lab-based $^{87}$Rb gravimeter~\cite{LouchetChauvet2011}, a space-borne $^{87}$Rb gradiometer~\cite{Trimeche2019} and a satellite $^{87}$Rb/$^{41}$K WEP-test analogous to the STE-QUEST mission~\cite{Aguilera2014}. The phase uncertainties are given as fractions $\Delta a/g=\delta_\phi/k_\text{eff}gT^2$ (gravimeter and WEP-test) and $\Delta \Gamma=\delta_\phi/k_\text{eff}DT^2$ (space gradiometer). The expansion sequence over the course of the atom interferometer is calculated in \autoref{tab:DKC}. Systematic effects are denoted by $\delta$, while statistical effects are denoted by $\sigma$ and calculated after integrating over a number $n_\text{cycle}$ of experiments with N$_\text{at}$ atoms in each cycle. Gravity gradients are abbreviated with GG, the Coriolis effect with C, wave-front aberrations by WFA, shot noise with SN and mean-field effects by MF.}
