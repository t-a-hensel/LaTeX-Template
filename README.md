#TODO:	-how to properly format git_version when (not given)-> should be in header...
#		-how to handle mutliple submission arguments, i.e. access the different entries?
#			Maybe just handle a complete dictionary?
#		-how to incorporate arxiv collector for submission?
#		-how to use LaTeXDiff?
#		-in the main makefile, 'make submission' throws the switch such that the gitversion is stored as one option. 
#			Is that a good way or is there a better way to do this?

## the following solutions are flawed:
	- HackMD (+pandoc converter)
	- Manubot
	-Teletype + atom
	- VimLaTeX
that is why we need RevTeX + Git for collaborative writing and living documents with python support.
